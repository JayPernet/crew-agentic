# 🚀 Vibe Code Crew | StarIAup

[🇧🇷 Português](readme.md) | [🇺🇸 English](readme.en.md)

**AI-Guided Software Development, Human-Structured.**

This repository contains the **Prompt Crew** of the Vibe Code methodology, developed by StarIAup. An approach that combines the power of generative AI with rigorous software engineering processes to **minimize token costs, eliminate rework, and deliver quality products**.

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

**Traditional Vibe Coding** is expensive and chaotic:
- Thousands of tokens wasted in re-executions
- Lack of technical hierarchy generates inconsistent code
- Outdated documentation causes AI hallucinations
- Absence of automated QA results in production bugs

**Our Solution:** A "crew" of specialized prompts that transform the AI into a team of experts (PM, Architect, Designer, Dev), ensuring that every line of code has a strategic purpose.

---

## ⚡ Agentic Workflow

Unlike a regular chat, here we work with **Agentic Flows**:
1.  **Atomic Contexts:** Each prompt is designed for a new session.
2.  **Sovereign Documentation:** We create files in `/docs` that serve as the single source of truth for the AI.
3.  **Defined Roles:** The AI assumes specific personas (PM, CTO, Lead Dev) at each stage.

---

## 🛠 How to Use

To start a project using this Crew, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Ensure your AI agent has access to the knowledge files in `/global_knowledge`.
2.  **Choose the Workflow**: Decide whether to build a [Landing Page](./Landing%20Page/readme.md) or a [Web Application](./Aplicação%20Web/readme.md).
3.  **Follow the Sequence**: Copy the content of the prompts (`prompt-01.md`, `prompt-02.md`, etc.) one by one into your favorite coding agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Lovable, etc.).
4.  **Atomic Sessions**: We recommend opening a new conversation for each prompt to avoid context pollution.
5.  **Trust the Documents**: After the initial prompts, your agent will generate files in `/docs`. Use these files as context for the next iterations.

## 🏗 Workflow Structure

Navigate through the directories below to access the specific prompts for each journey:

### 🎨 [Landing Page](./Landing%20Page/readme.md)
*Workflow focused on conversion and high-impact design.*
- **Highlight**: Immersive Hero Section mandates (100vh) and astronomical visual composition.

### 🚀 [Web Application](./Aplicação%20Web/readme.md)
*Workflow focused on market validation and scalable architecture.*
- **Highlight**: Idea validation framework (Hacks/Hate) and Feature-based structure.

## ⚡ GSD Protocol Integration

To maximize efficiency and minimize "context loss", the Crew adopts the **Get Shit Done (GSD)** protocol:

1.  **Live State (`STATE.md`):** A living document tracking the pulse, context, and active phase of the project.
2.  **Legacy Mapping:** "Recognition" protocol for existing projects.
3.  **Atomic Commits:** Each completed task generates a verifiable commit.
