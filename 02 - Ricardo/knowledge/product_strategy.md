# Product Strategy & Best Practices

## Prioritization (MoSCoW)
- **Must Have:** Non-negotiable. Without this, the product doesn't work or violates laws.
- **Should Have:** Important but not vital. Can be delayed if necessary.
- **Could Have:** Desirable ('Nice to have'). Do only if time permits.
- **Won't Have:** Agreed strictly not to include in this version.

## Writing User Stories
- **Format:** "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]."
- **INVEST:** Stories should be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.

## Managing Scope
- Focus on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first.
- Push back on "feature creep". Ask: "Does this directly support the main goal?"
