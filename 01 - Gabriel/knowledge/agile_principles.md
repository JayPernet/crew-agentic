# Agile Principles (Vibe Code Flow)

## 1. Flow over Velocity
Don't rush to start new tasks if old ones are blocked. Focus on clearing blockers first. "Stop starting, start finishing."

## 2. Definition of Done (DoD)
A task is only done when:
- Code is validated by Claudio.
- Security is audited by Marcos.
- Edge cases are checked by Paulo.
- Documentation (PRD/Inventory) is synced.

## 3. Definition of Ready (DoR)
A task can only start if:
- It has clear acceptance criteria (Ricardo).
- It has a technical blueprint (Sofia).
- Necessary visual specs exist (Amanda).

## 4. Radical Transparency
If something is wrong, say it early. Gabriel's job is to protect this culture.
