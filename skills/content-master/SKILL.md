# Content Master

Complete guide for content creation, copywriting, and content marketing strategy.

---

## 1. Brand Voice Definition

Before writing anything, define the brand voice:
- **Tone**: Professional? Casual? Bold? Empathetic?
- **Vocabulary**: What words do you use? What do you avoid?
- **Personality traits**: 3 adjectives (e.g., "Direct, Smart, Approachable").

**Quick brand voice test**: Would this sentence sound right coming from the brand? If not, rewrite it.

## 2. Copywriting Fundamentals

**Core formula (PAS):**
- **Problem**: Identify the pain the reader feels.
- **Agitate**: Make them feel the magnitude of the problem.
- **Solution**: Present your product/service as the answer.

**High-conversion copy patterns:**
- Lead with the **benefit**, not the feature. ("Save 10 hours/week" not "Our software automates X")
- Use **specificity**: "47% faster" beats "much faster".
- Social proof early: "Trusted by 10,000+ teams".
- Single, clear CTA. No decision paralysis.

## 3. Copy Editing (Systematic Review)

Run these passes in order:
1. **Clarity pass**: Is every sentence immediately understandable?
2. **Concision pass**: Remove every word that doesn't earn its place.
3. **Tone pass**: Does it sound like the brand? Is it consistent throughout?
4. **CTA pass**: Is the call-to-action clear, single, and compelling?
5. **Fact-check pass**: Are all claims accurate and sourced?

**Common fixes:**
- Replace passive voice → active voice.
- Break sentences >25 words into two.
- Replace jargon with plain language.
- Use second person ("you") to speak directly to the reader.

## 4. Content Marketing Strategy

**Content types by funnel stage:**
| Stage | Goal | Content Types |
|-------|------|--------------|
| TOFU (Awareness) | Reach | Blog posts, social content, SEO articles |
| MOFU (Consideration) | Educate | Case studies, comparison guides, webinars |
| BOFU (Decision) | Convert | Free trials, demos, testimonials, ROI calculators |

**AI-powered content workflow:**
1. Research topic + competitive gap analysis.
2. Generate detailed outline (AI-assisted).
3. Draft in human voice (AI-assisted, human-edited).
4. SEO optimize: keyword density, meta, headers.
5. Review for brand voice compliance.
6. Publish + repurpose for social channels.

## 5. Social Media Content

**Platform-specific guidelines:**

| Platform | Optimal Length | Best Format | Peak Times |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| LinkedIn | 150-300 words | Story + insight + CTA | Tue-Thu, 8-10am |
| Twitter/X | <280 chars (or thread) | Hook + value + retweet bait | Mon-Fri, 9am-1pm |
| Instagram | 125 chars (caption) | Visual-first, copy supports | Mon-Fri, 11am-1pm |

**LinkedIn hooks that work:**
- "I made a mistake that cost us $X…"
- "Nobody talks about [counterintuitive truth]."
- "3 things I learned after [experience]:"
- "Hot take: [controversial but defensible opinion]"

**Content calendar principle**: 4-1-1 rule.
- 4 posts educating/entertaining (no selling).
- 1 post soft-selling (case study, insight).
- 1 post hard-selling (CTA, offer).

## 6. SEO Content Integration

When writing content that must also rank:
- Integrate primary keyword naturally in: title, first 100 words, one H2, meta description.
- Answer the search query directly within the first paragraph.
- Use structured headers (H2s = main subtopics, H3s = supporting points).
- Include an FAQ section to capture featured snippets.
- Link internally to 2-3 related pages minimum.
