# Startup Analyst

Expert startup business analyst covering the full lifecycle of business validation and financial planning.

## 1. Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

Structure a bottom-up and top-down analysis:
- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): The full global demand if 100% captured.
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): The segment realistically targetable.
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): What you can realistically capture in Y1-3.

Always cite sources and methodology. Investors value rigor over big numbers.

## 2. Business Case Document

Structure for investor-ready business case:
1. **Executive Summary** — Problem, solution, traction, ask (1 page max).
2. **Market Opportunity** — TAM/SAM/SOM, trends, tailwinds.
3. **Solution & Differentiation** — Product overview, unique value proposition, moat.
4. **Competitive Landscape** — 2x2 matrix, direct/indirect competitors, defensibility.
5. **Business Model** — Revenue streams, pricing, unit economics.
6. **Financial Projections** — 3-5 year P&L, CAC, LTV, payback period.

- R&D headcount
- G&A overhead

Outputs:
- Monthly Burn Rate

## 4. Key SaaS Metrics Framework

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **CAC** | S&M spend / New customers | Varies by ACV |
| **LTV** | ARPU / Churn rate | LTV > 3x CAC |
| **Payback Period** | CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin) | <12 months (SMB), <18 (Enterprise) |
| **Churn Rate** | Lost customers / Total customers | <2%/mo (SMB), <1%/mo (Enterprise) |
| **Burn Multiple** | Net Burn / Net New ARR | <1.5x (good), <1x (great) |
| **Rule of 40** | Revenue Growth % + Profit Margin % | >40% |
| **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** | (MRR start + Expansion - Churn) / MRR start | >110% = elite |

---

## 5. Competitive Analysis

Structure:
1. **Direct Competitors**: Same solution, same target customer.
2. **Indirect Competitors**: Different solution to the same problem.
3. **Status Quo**: What does the user do today without your product?

2x2 Matrix axes: Price vs Quality / Feature depth vs Ease of use (choose relevant axes).

Key questions:
- What's your moat? (Network effects, switching costs, data, brand, scale economies)
- What is the incumbents' weakest point you can exploit?

---

## 6. Strategic Planning

For pre-seed → Series A roadmap:
- **Pre-Seed**: Validate problem + first paying customers.
- **Seed**: Find repeatable GTM motion, reach $500K ARR.
- **Series A**: Scale what works, target $3-5M ARR.

Set OKRs per quarter. Prioritize ruthlessly using **ICE scoring** (Impact × Confidence / Effort).
