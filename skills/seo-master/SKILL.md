# SEO Master

A comprehensive SEO skill covering the full spectrum from fundamentals to tactical execution.

---

## 1. Fundamentals

Core principles of modern SEO:
- **E-E-A-T**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness — especially critical for YMYL topics.
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, INP, CLS — a page that loads fast and feels stable ranks better.
- **Search Intent**: Match content type (informational, navigational, transactional) to the query intent.
- **Technical Health**: Crawlability, indexation, canonical tags, mobile-friendliness, structured data.

---

## 2. SEO Audit (Technical Review)

Use when asked for an "SEO audit", "technical SEO review", or "ranking diagnosis".

**Checklist:**
- ✅ `robots.txt` — Blocking important pages?
- ✅ Sitemap — Present, submitted, up-to-date?
- ✅ Canonical tags — Self-referencing where needed?
- ✅ Meta titles & descriptions — Unique, within character limits?
- ✅ Heading structure — Single H1, logical H2–H6 hierarchy?
- ✅ Core Web Vitals — LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1
- ✅ Mobile-friendliness — Responsive layout?
- ✅ Internal links — Pages with zero internal links?
- ✅ 404s and redirects — Broken links / redirect chains?

## 3. Keyword Strategy

Use when analyzing keyword coverage, researching topics, or planning content clusters.

- Analyze keyword **density** — avoid over-optimization (>2.5% is a risk).
- Suggest **semantic variations** and LSI keywords to broaden topical coverage.
- Build **topic clusters**: Pillar page (broad) → Cluster pages (specific subtopics).
- Identify opportunities for **featured snippets** (Q&A, lists, tables, step-by-step).

---

## 4. Keyword Cannibalization Detection

Use when multiple pages are competing for the same keyword.

- Identify pages with overlapping title tags, H1s, and target keywords.
- Recommend: consolidate (301 redirect), differentiate intent, or canonicalize one page.

---

## 5. Content Writing & Editing (SEO-Optimized)

When writing or editing content for SEO:
1. Lead with the primary keyword in the first 100 words.
2. Use H2s for main subtopics (include secondary keywords naturally).
3. Write for humans first, search engines second.
4. Include FAQ sections to capture featured snippets.
5. Add a strong meta description (120–158 chars) that includes the primary keyword.

---

## 6. Meta Optimization

Generate optimized:
- **Title tags**: 50–60 chars, primary keyword near the front.
- **Meta descriptions**: 120–158 chars, include CTA and keyword.
- **URLs**: Lowercase, hyphens, no stop words, keyword-rich slug.

---

## 7. Content Auditing & Refreshing

For existing content that has dropped in traffic:
1. Identify outdated statistics, dates, or examples.
2. Check if keyword intent has shifted.
3. Add recent sources, update pub date.
4. Expand thin sections, remove duplicate content.
5. Strengthen internal links to and from this page.

---

## 8. E-E-A-T & Authority Building

Signals that build trust for Google:
- Author bios with credentials visible on-page.
- External citations from authoritative sources.
- "About" and "Contact" pages clearly accessible.
- Reviews, testimonials, case studies (social proof).
- Schema markup: `Article`, `FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `Review`, `Organization`.

---

## 9. Content Structure Optimization

For maximum crawlability and readability:
- Single `<h1>` per page, matching the title tag.
- Logical `H2 → H3 → H4` nesting.
- Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences), use bullet lists for scannable content.
- Schema.org structured data for rich results.

---

## 10. Featured Snippet Hunting

Structure content to appear in position 0:
- Answer the target question within the first 50 words.
- Follow with a list or table for listicle snippets.
- Use `<table>` for comparison snippets.
- Add FAQ-style `H2`/`H3` questions throughout the content.
