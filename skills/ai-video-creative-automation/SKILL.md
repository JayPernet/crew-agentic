# AI Video Creative Automation

Efficiently generate high-quality video scripts and prompts for advanced AI video models (VEO 3) and music video production.

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

### What are you creating?

1.  **A Cinematic Historical Short (VEO 3):**
    *   Goal: Automated 12-scene historical story with consistency checks.
    *   Jump to: [Historical VEO 3 Workflow](references/historical-veo3/README.md)

2.  **A Professional Music Video Script:**
    *   Goal: Technical "frame-to-end" script with precise visual transitions and timestamps.
    *   Jump to: [Music Video Screenwriting](references/music-video-scripts/README.md)

## When to Use

- When building long-form historical narratives for YouTube/Social Media.
- When acting as a Screenwriter for music bands or solo artists.
- When precise visual consistency (Character DNA) is required across multiple scenes.
- When generating prompts specifically for image-to-video or frame-to-frame workflows.

## Workflow Summary

| Workflow | Key Framework | Output Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Historical** | Consistency Lock | VEO 3 Prompts + Narration |
| **Music Video** | Frame-to-End | Detailed .md Script with Timestamps |

## Common Gotchas

- **Historical**: Always ensure "Prompt 2 - Consistency Lock" is executed before generating scene prompts.
- **Music Video**: The "Last Frame" of a scene MUST be the "First Frame" of the next unless a hard cut is specified.
- **Safety**: Keep all content family-friendly and YouTube-safe (no gore).
