# Gotchas: AI Video Creative Automation

Critical pitfalls and rules to ensure the skill works effectively.

## 🛡️ Safety & Ethics
- **Strictly Family-Friendly**: No gore, explicit violence, or modern political controversy.
- **Symbolic Action**: Use metaphors (e.g., a falling flag) instead of direct combat.

## 🎥 Continuity (The "Drift" Problem)
- **Character DNA**: If the "Signature Item" is a gold compass, it MUST appear in every scene description.
- **Lighting Drift**: Changing from "Golden Hour" to "Neon Blue" mid-story without a story reason breaks the viewer's immersion.
- **Frame-to-End**: In music videos, if you describe a close-up ending and the next scene starts as a wide shot without a cut marker, the AI will fail to generate a smooth transition.

## ⚙️ Technical Limitations
- **Scene Length**: VEO 3 and similar models perform best with 5-10 second clips. Exceeding 8 seconds in Music Video scripts increases the chance of visual distortion.
- **Text in Video**: Avoid describing text on signs or shirts unless absolutely necessary, as AI models often struggle with legible typography.

## 🎙️ Voice & Audio
- **Narration Pace**: The script should have "breathing room". Do not crowd 8 seconds of video with 20 seconds of text.
- **Timestamps**: Always verify the user provided lirycs with timestamps before starting a music video script.
