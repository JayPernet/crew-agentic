# Agent Behavioral Rules

These rules must be followed by any AI agent working on this project.

## Testing and Security Rules

1. **PROHIBITED: Changing Active Credentials**: Agents should never perform write actions that change passwords, login emails, or access permissions of real user/developer accounts during automated or manual testing.
2. **Use of Test Accounts**: If a test requires changing credentials, the agent must request the creation of a specific test account or use a sandbox environment where real data is not affected.
3. **Preservation of Production/Dev Data**: The integrity of access accounts is a top priority. No automation should compromise user access to the system.
4. **File Deletion**: Never delete project files without **detailing exactly** what is being deleted and why.
5. **Implementation-plan.md**: The file generated by Antigravity must be **extremely detailed at all times** and **followed to the letter** to avoid problems.

## Browser Usage Rules

1. **Before testing a specific functionality**: Check the corresponding files to understand what the backend expects and what the frontend is sending.
2. **Check the user logged into the system**: If a specific functionality is restricted to a certain type of user, log in with that user before testing the functionality.
3. **Be careful with the data being sent to the backend**: Although the database is not the one used in production, the data is being sent to the backend and may cause system instability.
